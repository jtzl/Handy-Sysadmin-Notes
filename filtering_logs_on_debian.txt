In general, syslog-ng has 3 components in the conf file:  destinations, filters, and log definitions.

the destination is where you associate names with files:

# puppet log destination
destination df_puppet { file("/var/log/puppet.log"); };

If you're using system logging facilities, you can remove a particular type of data from a particular type of log, say getting mail entries out of syslog, using the following convention in syslog-ng.conf

# filter to remove anything that uses mail log facility from syslog
filter f_syslog { not facility(mail) }

syslog-ng filters also support regex so you can do things like:

# filter to omit puppetd entries from daemon.log
filter f_daemon { facility(daemon) and not match ("puppetd"); };

The above entry removes puppet-associated data from the daemon log, but we need to catch those entries elsewhere like so:

# filter to collect puppetd entries from daemon facility
filter f_puppet { facility(daemon) and match("puppetd"); };

Now we've got a puppet filter going...but what about the log definition?

log {
        source(s_all);
        filter(f_puppet);
        destination(df_puppet);
};
